# GhostCore-TacticalSystems

**Advanced Tactical Systems for Reactor-Powered Deployment Frameworks**

This repository contains simulation modules, AI configs, and deployment schematics for GhostCore's autonomous weapons framework, including the GhostLance DRX, microdrone swarms, EMP payloads, and directed-energy systems.

All systems are purely theoretical and intended for research, simulation, and educational purposes under open defense architecture modeling.
