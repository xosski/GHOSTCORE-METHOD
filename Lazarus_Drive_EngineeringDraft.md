## 🔧 Subsystem Breakdown

### 1. PhotonCore Output
- Emits directional radiation pulses at high frequency
- Tuned for radiative pressure & thermal-vector propulsion
- Synchronized with rotating magnetic flux chamber

### 2. Magnetic Spin Chamber
- Molten lead or superconductive torus mass
- Rotated at relativistic speeds using embedded magneto-drive rails
- Creates artificial frame-drag & gravitational coupling

### 3. Lazarus Pulse Coils
- EM pulse emitters placed equidistant around core
- Fire asynchronously to destabilize local inertial frame
- Generate inertial null zone via synchronized destructive interference

### 4. Inertial Null Bubble
- Localized region around core with reduced resistance to thrust
- Amplifies photon pressure effect from PhotonCore
- Reduces effective ship mass during active spin-cycle

## ⚛️ Physics Concept Overview

- Lazarus Drive bends space by suppressing internal inertial drag.
- It mimics gravitational frame-drag (Lense-Thirring effect) via rotation + EM harmonics.
- Photon emission gains leverage when ship's mass is "slippery."

## 🧬 Conclusion

The Lazarus Drive isn't a warp engine. It's a cheat code against mass. Using spin, radiation, and magnetism,
GhostCore redefines the boundary of what's "possible."
